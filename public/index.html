        <details>
            <summary>What is PM2.5?</summary>
            <p>PM2.5 represents particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less. 
                These particles are so diminutive that they are approximately 30 times smaller than the width of a human strand. 
                PM2.5 particles are capable of being inhaled deeply into the lungs and even entering the bloodstream, 
                which poses significant health dangers, due to their diminutive size.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How does air quality affect health?</summary>
            <p>Human health is significantly affected by air quality, which has both short-term and long-term consequences. 
                A variety of health issues can result from poor air quality, which is caused by pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone (O₃), 
                nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and sulphur dioxide (SO₂).</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What are the primary sources of air pollution?</summary>
            <p>Air pollution is caused by both natural sources like wildfires and dust storms and human activities such as industrial emissions, 
                vehicle exhaust, burning of fossil fuels, and agricultural activities.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What is the AQI (Air Quality Index)?</summary>
            <p>The AQI is a standardized system used to measure and report air quality levels. 
                It assigns a value based on pollutant concentrations and categorizes air quality from "Good" to "Hazardous."</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What are the health effects of long-term exposure to poor air quality?</summary>
            <p>Long-term exposure to polluted air can lead to chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchitis, cardiovascular diseases, 
                and even cancer.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How can I protect myself from air pollution?</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Stay indoors on days with high pollution levels.</li>
              <li>Use air purifiers.</li>
              <li>Wear masks designed to filter out particulate matter (PM2.5).</li>
              <li>Avoid heavy outdoor exercise during peak pollution hours.</li>
            </ul>
