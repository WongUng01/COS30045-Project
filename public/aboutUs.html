                Welcome to our project on air quality and its profound implications on health and sustainability. 
                Our initiative centers around understanding the effects of PM2.5, 
                a fine particulate matter that poses significant risks to human health and the environment. 
                By leveraging the power of data visualization, we aim to unravel the complex dynamics of air pollution and 
                inspire actionable solutions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We are driven by a mission to bridge the gap between environmental data and public understanding. 
                Our focus is on examining Malaysia's air quality in the broader context of global industrial and economic development. 
                By analyzing trends, comparing emission levels, and understanding their health and economic impacts, 
                we seek to contribute to informed decision-making for a sustainable future.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
                Our project delves into the intricate relationship between industrialization, air quality, and health outcomes. 
                Key areas of focus include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking and comparing PM2.5 levels across developed and developing nations.</li>
                <li>Exploring how nations transition from industrial growth to cleaner technologies.</li>
                <li>Highlighting the economic and health consequences of air pollution.</li>
                <li>Identifying major sources of PM2.5 emissions in Malaysia.</li>
                <li>Creating interactive and accessible data visualizations to educate and engage the public.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Through our work, we envision a future where Malaysia and other developing nations achieve cleaner air, healthier communities, and sustainable growth. By learning from the successes of developed nations and integrating cutting-edge technology, we believe it’s possible to balance industrialization with environmental responsibility.
