            <p>The datasets used in this project have undergone careful curation and processing to ensure they align with the objectives of our study. 
                Each dataset has been meticulously cleaned, structured, and enriched to provide the most accurate and relevant insights into air quality trends and their impacts on public health and the environment. 
                Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, ensuring consistency across different formats, and normalizing variables to enable accurate comparisons and visualizations. 
                Each dataset included information from reputable sources such as the OECD, World Bank, and Our World in Data, providing a comprehensive perspective on issues like PM2.5 exposure, fossil fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions from transport. 
                The processed datasets are listed below for convenient access and download:</p>
